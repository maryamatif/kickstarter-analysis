# ANALYSIS OF KICKSTARTER CHALLENGE FINDINGS
# Overview of Project
The purpose of this project was to analyze data about a variety of fundraising goals relating to different art campaigns. By filtering, formatting and cleaning a large amount of data given to us, we were able to draw valuable insights that could help us further in our research. 
# Analysis and Challenges
The exercise wasn’t too bad and the instructions given were quite clear so I didn’t encounter any problems. 
One thing that’s really easy to miss when writing formulas are absolute and relative referencing. There were times when my answers came out weird because I didn’t realize the selected data set was moving as I copied and pasted the formula. Another thing to remember is to be accurate when you’re selecting data to create a pivot table. A lot of times, you know the data you want but it can be hard to choose the column, value and filter fields. 
# Results: Answer the following questions in complete and coherent sentences.
# What are two conclusions you can draw about the Theater Outcomes based on Launch Date?
1. The months of May and June experienced the highest amount of successful theatre campaigns. 
2. Overall majority of theatre campaigns were successful with the ratio of successful to unsuccessful and cancelled campaigns being 2:1.
# What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Campaigns for plays were all either successful or failed but no campaign was cancelled. 100% of campaigns aimed at raising $45000 to $49000 failed which shows that people weren’t willing to pay that much for plays in general. That statement is verified as we see that the highest amount of successful campaigns had the lowest goal in terms of dollar amount (upto $5000). This shows that people prefer other kinds of art categories over plays.
# What are some limitations of this dataset?
The dataset doesn’t give us any qualitative reasons behind the customer behaviour for choosing to contribute to any specific campaign. We also don’t get to see any structural changes that happened over time which could explain the difference in amounts donated. The sample size is also not big enough considering the population of the countries in question. 
# What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
1. A histogram of absolute outcomes could give us a better indication of the situation than working with percentages. It could also help identify any outliers. For example, for outcomes based on goals for the play category, our graph tells us that approximately 70% of campaigns aiming for $1000 and $45000 were successful. However if we look at absolute numbers, we can see that there were much more campaigns for a lesser amount of money ($1000) than for more ($45000).
2. We could also visualize the successful outcomes based on the length of the campaign. That could give us additional information about consumer behaviour.
